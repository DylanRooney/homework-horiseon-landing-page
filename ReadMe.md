# **Horiseon Marketing Refactor**

## **What has changed?**

In this Refactor homework assignment, I changed the Div Tags to be more semantic, That would mean making sure as well that they make sense
What I changed was the div tags to include instead was:

- Nav tags
- Section tags
- Footer Tags

### ***What happened to the images?***

I have added Alt tags to the images to make it more accessable

### ***What about the CSS file?***

The CSS file was updated to include comments and Work with the new tags
I changed the div tag in CSS to nav, so the navbar at the top worked correctly.
The comments show an understanding of the different selectors, display, margins, padding and colours.

### ***Links***

All the links go to anchor tags depending on what the user clicks.

### ***Image***

I have attached an image of the demo website
